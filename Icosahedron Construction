Draft Specification: Vector-Based Icosahedron ConstructionProject: Icosahedron Model / EnclosureType: 1V Frequency Regular IcosahedronFabrication Method: 2D Sheet Material Vector Cutting1. Scope and ApplicationsThis specification details the geometric requirements, design strategies, and adjustments needed to construct a regular icosahedron from flat sheet materials. It addresses two primary assembly methods suitable for vector cutting:Folded Net: A single-piece cut with scored lines, ideal for thin, flexible materials (paper, thin plastics, sheet metal).Slotted Interlocking: Multiple identical pieces that slot together, ideal for rigid, thicker materials (acrylic, plywood, MDF).2. Geometric Definitions & ReferencesA regular icosahedron is composed of 20 congruent equilateral triangles. Five triangles meet at each of the 12 vertices. It has 30 edges.2.1 Basic Parameters$a$: Side Length (Edge length of the equilateral triangle).Dihedral Angle ($\alpha$): The internal angle between two adjacent faces.$$\alpha = \arccos\left(-\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right) \approx 138.19^\circ$$Miter Angle (for compound cuts): If creating beveled edges, the miter angle is half the supplementary angle of the dihedral angle.$$\text{Miter} = \frac{180^\circ - \alpha}{2} \approx 20.9^\circ$$2.2 Target Geometry Coordinates (Optional Reference)If modeling in 3D, Cartesian coordinates for vertices of an icosahedron centered at the origin with edge length $a = 2$ can be defined using the golden ratio $\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618$:$(0, \pm 1, \pm \phi)$$(\pm 1, \pm \phi, 0)$$(\pm \phi, 0, \pm 1)$3. Vector Design Methodology3.1 Design ProcessThe design must be created as 2D vector paths (e.g., DXF, SVG, AI format) optimized for the chosen fabrication machine. Lines must be stratified by operation (e.g., color-coded for Cut, Score, or Engrave).3.2 Method A: Folded Net (Thin/Flexible Materials)A net is a 2D unrolling of the 3D shape. A standard icosahedron net resembles a strip of ten triangles with two "caps" of five triangles attached to the top and bottom edges.Design Elements:Outer Perimeter: Vector line type set to Cut (Through).Internal Edges: Vector line type set to Score/Etch (Partial depth) to create precise fold lines.Glue Tabs (Optional): Extensions added to edges that will be joined. They do not exist in the theoretical geometry but are required for assembly.3.3 Method B: Slotted Interlocking (Rigid Materials)This method consists of cutting 20 identical equilateral triangles with interlocking tabs and slots. This creates a stable structure without adhesives.Design Elements:Main Body: 20 equilateral triangles with side length $a$.Slots: Rectangular cutouts placed on the edges. The orientation of the slots must accommodate the dihedral angle ($\sim 138^\circ$) when assembled. See Section 4 for thickness-based adjustments of slots.4. Adjustments Based on Material ThicknessMaterial thickness ($t$) is the critical parameter for the success of slotted interlocking designs. The fundamental design issue is that rigid materials are not 2D; they have volume. The inner faces of the triangles must meet precisely to maintain the correct geometry.4.1 Kerf CompensationVector cutting removing a small amount of material (the kerf, $k$). For interlocking joints to fit snugly, the kerf must be measured and compensated for in the design.Axe-Symmetric Measurement: Cut a small test square. $k = (\text{Designed Width} - \text{Measured Width})$.Adjustment:Male Tabs: Increase dimensions by $k/2$.Female Slots: Decrease dimensions by $k/2$.For standard laser systems, $k \approx 0.1 \text{ mm to } 0.3 \text{ mm}$.4.2 Interlocking Slot Dimensioning ($t > 0$)The standard approach for vector-cut polyhedra is to place two slots on each edge. The slot must be sized to accommodate the thickness of the mating piece, accounting for kerf.Standard Rule: Make slots slightly smaller than material thickness ($t$) to account for kerf and ensure a friction fit.$$\text{Slot Width in CAD} = t - k \quad \text{(Try a test fit first)}$$Slot Orientation: Slots are typically oriented perpendicularly to the edge. However, because the dihedral angle is obtuse ($\sim 138^\circ$), an orthogonal slot will cause the rigid pieces to collision on the outer edges before the inner edges meet.4.3 Handling Outer Edge Collision (The Interference Problem)When $t > 0$, the outer edge of the material will touch its neighbor before the internal angle is closed, creating a gap on the inside.Solution 1: Compound Miter Cutting (Not Vector-Based): The only way to have the faces meet perfectly on all surfaces is to bevel every edge at the miter angle of $\sim 20.9^\circ$. This requires a 5-axis CNC, table saw, or specialized jig. It is generally not achievable on standard laser cutters or 3-axis routers.Solution 2: Truncated Edge Method (Vector-Optimized): This is the practical solution for flat-sheet vector cutting. The theoretical equilateral triangle is truncated on its outside edge to allow the inner faces to meet at the vertices while providing clearance for the thick material.The triangle cut path is made smaller than the theoretical $a$.Slots are designed to hold the inner edges together.4.4 Advanced Parametric SlottingFor thicker, highly rigid materials, advanced slotting methods account for the dihedral angle. These joints often look less like standard tabs and more like angled knuckles or complex interlocking fingers. They often require 3D modeling with sheet-metal tools to verify clearance before flattening for 2D export.5.
